* One of my pre-registered subjects is gone, what happened to it?
    You might have failed the pre-requisite subject you have taken the previous semester or the faculty has not submitted your grade yet. Check your flowchart.
* I have already logged in on OnE, but I am unable to access the online registration, what do I do?
    These holds prevent you from enrolling in courses or viewing your grades but not from logging in. There are several reasons for your holds -- each with a different way or office to address or clear it. You must resolve your hold with the office that initiated it. For example, if you have a balance from your tuition and other fees, you will need to pay it and clear your account from the Student Accounts Section to have this hold removed.
* My COR says I'm an APM11 student, what does it mean?
    APM11 is your program code and section code. APM is the program code (progcode) for BS Applied Mathematics and 11 is the section code (sectcode) for freshmen, section 1. All programs in the University have assigned progcodes.
* I'm currently listed as a sophomore, but I should be listed as a junior, how do I change my class standing?
    You have to go to the Records Evaluator in charge of your program. For example, if you are a junior BS Biology student, go to the Office of the Registrar. Your records will be reviewed before changes are made.
* I currently belong to HUB21 but I would like to transfer to HUB22, how do I go about it?
    Submit a letter of request to change the section to the department where your program belongs. For example, if you are a BS Biology student, go to the Biological Sciences Department.
* How can I confirm that I am officially enrolled in courses?
    You will be able to print your COR and your name will appear on your professor's class list.
* My online registration shows Transaction 2, what is it?
    Transaction 2 is an updated version of your COR. This means you changed or added one or more subjects from your first transaction. Every change of registration means additional transactions.
* Is there a limit to online enrollment transactions?
    Yes, the maximum is 3. However, on a case to case basis, a fourth transaction may be allowed. You need to pay a specific amount before you could proceed to Transaction 4.
* Why is it that I can view the subjects in OnE, but, I can not add it to my registration?
    Most of the time, the reason is that a particular subject is exclusive for other programs.
* For example, I want to enroll in ENGL102, but, I can't search it. Why is it so?
    There are two possible reasons: it's either ENGL102 is not offered for enrollment or you did not pass ENGL101, which is a pre-requisite of ENGL102. Some subjects have pre-requisites. Students must pass these subjects before enrolling.
* How can I update my name?
    For name correction or change, submit a copy of the PSA-certified birth certificate and supporting document to the Records Section (Counter 2). Proceed to the ID Section (Counter 7).
* Do I have to apply for graduation?
    Yes. You can get the application for graduation form from the Records Evaluator assigned to your program.
* Is there a graduation fee?
    Yes. Verify the amount at the Student Accounts Section.
* Do I still have to pay the graduation fee if I will not attend the commencement ceremonies?
    Yes.
* When will I know if I am graduating with academic honors?
    You will be notified a week before the graduation date by the Office of the Registrar.
* Do I need entry cards and/or invitations for the Graduation Rites?
    Yes. These will be given to you right after the general rehearsal.
* If I am expecting to graduate in the first semester or summer term, when is the approximate time of my commencement ceremonies?
    You will graduate with first Semester/summer Term commencement ceremonies, if there is a schedule.
* May I delay my participation and join the second semester commencement ceremonies?
    No. You may only participate in your scheduled term of commencement ceremonies.
* Who can request for a transcript of records (TOR)?
    Any current or former student at De La Salle University-Dasmari√±as can request for a TOR through the Office of the Registrar Counter 1.
* Can I get an electronic version of my TOR?
    No. Electronic TORs are not available.
* Can I get an unofficial version of my TOR?
    No. But you can view all of your grades online using the Student Portal.
* How many TORs can I request?
    There is no limit.
* How long will you hold my TOR until I or my authorized representative claims it?

* Can I request for TOR if there is a financial hold on my account?
    No. You must settle your financial obligation to the University before we can release your TOR.
